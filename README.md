`scroll_restore` is a tiny Flutter package that **automatically saves and restores** the scroll position of any scrollable widget—across rebuilds, hot reloads, navigation pops/pushes, and even app restarts. No boilerplate, no manual state management: just wrap your `ListView`, `GridView`, or any scrollable, and it “just works.”

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Persist scroll offset using `SharedPreferences`  
- ✅ Restore position on init (clamps if content is shorter)  
- ✅ Simple, one-widget API  
- ✅ Zero external dependencies (except `shared_preferences`)  
- ✅ Compatible with mobile, web, and desktop Flutter apps

---

## 📦 Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  scroll_restore: ^0.1.3+1
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Wrap your scrollable in ScrollRestore, giving it a unique id:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_restore/scroll_restore.dart';

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Chat')),
      body: ScrollRestore(
        id: 'chat_screen_list',  // unique key per scrollable
        builder: (context, controller) {
          return ListView.builder(
            controller: controller,
            itemCount: messages.length,
            itemBuilder: (_, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(messages[index].text),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

`id`: persisted key in SharedPreferences. Use a different id for each scrollable you want to remember.

The package takes care of saving `.offset` on every scroll and jumping to it on next build.

## 📖 Example

A full example app lives in the example/ folder:

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Try scrolling halfway, hot-reloading, navigating away/back, or restarting the app—you’ll stay at the same scroll position!

## 🧪 Testing

To run the package’s unit & widget tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

## ⚙️ CI

We use GitHub Actions to:

```bash
flutter analyze

flutter test # package & example
```

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/dart.yml`

## 🛠️ Caveats & Tips

If the saved offset exceeds the new content’s max scroll, it’s clamped to the end.

Works with any ScrollController-driven widget: `ListView`, `GridView`, `CustomScrollView`, etc.

You can nest multiple `ScrollRestore` widgets on one screen by using different ids.
